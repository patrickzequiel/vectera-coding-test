# DECISIONS

See `AGENTS.md` for repository rules, conventions, and workflows. This file is for recording project choices, trade-offs, deviations, and future improvements.

Briefly note:
- Key choices you made & trade-offs.
- Deviations from the initial spec (if any) and why.
- Next improvements you'd make if you had more time.
- Time spent per area.
